# Excel Sales Performance Dashboard

## Business Problem

A retail company needed a simple way to monitor sales performance, identify top-performing products, and track regional revenue without using complex BI software. Management required a dashboard that updates automatically and allows quick filtering of results.

## Solution

I designed an interactive Excel dashboard that transforms raw transactional data into visual business insights using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and slicers.

The dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly understand revenue performance and make operational decisions.

## Key Features
